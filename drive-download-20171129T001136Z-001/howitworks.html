	<h1>How It Works</h1>
	<div>
		<h2>Aboout Our Process</h2>
		<p>We ensure that each of our Quirky Pet Adoption Agency family members are treated with the utmost care and compassion from the second they enter our shelter</p>
	</div>
	<div>
		<h2>Step 1: Rescue</h2>
		<p>Our world-renowned pet rescue team traverses the globe, from the hightops of the Himalayas to the subterraneous depths of the Pacific Ocean, to find and rescue endangered animals. Many of these creatures are endangered due to hazardous environmental conditions, human-acquired injuries, or natural causes. We befriend, heal, and house them in our state-of-the-art EarthEco facilities located in Quirky Pet Adoption Agency headquarters across the world.</p>

		<h2>Step 2: Rehabilitation</h2>
		<p>After introduction into our facilities, our animals are welcomed via creation of their own personalized living environments, conditioned based on temperature, humidity, foliage, sunlight exposure, and dietary needs. We make sure that each critter has a home that will warrant a healthy and wholesome recovery.</p>
	</div>
	<div>
		<h2>Step 3: Relocation</h2>
		<p>After specifically-designated periods of time, our critters are ready to move on to another home. That’s where you come in! We offer personal consultations to match your personality, lifestyle, and geographic location to a pet that’s perfect for you. We make sure that the transition happens smoothly, and that enough time is granted for you and your new friend to become calm and comfortable with one another.</p>
